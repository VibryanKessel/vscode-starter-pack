# VSCode Starter Pack

Welcome to my starter pack for Visual Studio Code! ðŸš€

This repository contains a file with all my favorite **VSCode** extensions, as well as **scripts** to **export** and **import** these extensions easily, while sorting them by operating system.

## Project structure

The repository is organized as follows:

/vscode-extensions.txt # List of all my VSCode extensions 
/macos/ # Export and import script for macOS 
/windows/ # Export and import script for Windows (CMD and PowerShell) 
/linux/ # Export and import script for Linux


### Extensions file

- `vscode-extensions.txt` contains the complete list of my extensions installed on VSCode.
- This file is updated automatically by the scripts in this repository.

### Scripts

Export and import scripts are separated by **operating system**. This facilitates the installation and management of extensions for each platform.

#### Export extensions

Use the scripts in the folder according to your OS to **export** your extensions from VSCode and save them in a `vscode-extensions.txt` file.

#### Import extensions

The same scripts can be used to **install** all extensions from the `vscode-extensions.txt` file on a new machine or after reinstalling VSCode.

## Instructions for use
